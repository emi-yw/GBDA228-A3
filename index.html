    In todays world so many people are struggling with their culture and self identity. My vision is to share my story and<br>
    experiences through illustrations of cartoon characters to create a safe space for other people to share their stories and to know<br>
    that they're not alone in how they feel. Hopefully by the end of summer 2023 this project will be up and launched with a<br> 
    Instagram account and a few illustrations to be posted. I want this account to be available to all ages and all cultures, where<br>
    anyone can safely be themselves and learn about their own culture without being ashamed.
